- Here was the task for my Python Class Final Exam: 
*Your challenge now is to build an series of regression equations that predict advertising effectiveness (clicks). For this project I want you to imagine that you're working as a digital advertising strategist. You're trying to learn what it is about the advertising campaigns that you're looking at that drove clicks.*

### Abstract:
- This analysis aims to assist Nike in understanding their customers’ experiences while shopping
for their products on Amazon, as well as understand the shopping experience of their
competitor’s customers. By providing insight as to what Nike and Adidas’ customers consider as
helpful or unhelpful in a review when shopping on Amazon, Nike will be able to improve their
product listings as needed to solve customer pain points and understand their competitors’
standing on Amazon. With the 8 topic models we created on Nike and Adidas’ top and bottom
quartile of reviews rated helpful or unhelpful, we determined the words and topics that contribute
to a review being categorized as most or least helpful and unhelpful. Understanding what
customers find informative in a review will assist Nike in improving their product descriptions as
well as help in understanding their competitor’s strengths and weaknesses while selling on
Amazon. While the differences between the topic models of the two companies were
underwhelming, we were still able to draw significant conclusions about what should be included
in a product description. Those conclusions typically converged around the idea that Nike should
focus on creating a strong image in the customer’s mind without the use of vague, ambiguous
wording while also including sport or activity specific information as it pertains to the product.

### Business Problem
- “Beat the Market” is a common phrase heard up and down Wall Street and the
investment world. It’s a reference to an investor, corporation, or fund seeing
better results than an industry standard. In the Investment world, performance is
everything. Firms are measured by a never-ending expectation of performing
better than the equity indices. If they want their current investor pool to be happy,
and to continue to grow the fund with new investments, they must strive to
maximize their ROI and minimize risk/losses.

- For this project, we are playing the role of a hedge fund, which is looking to build
a fund that maximizes gains while limiting risk. We will use the S&P 500 as the
benchmark index, as it is a commonly used index for many fund managers within
the industry.Heavy analysis and modeling are required if anyone stands a chance
of making this happen. There are several different methods used. The one we will
demonstrate in this project is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

- The capital asset pricing model is important in the world of financial modeling for
a few key reasons. Firstly, by helping investors calculate the expected return on an
investment, it helps determine how appropriate a particular investment may be.
Investors can use the CAPM for gauging their portfolio’s health and rebalancing,
if necessary. Secondly, it’s a relatively simple formula that’s fairly easy to use.
Additionally, the CAPM is an important tool for investors when it comes to
accessing both risk
